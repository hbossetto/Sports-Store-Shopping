# Sports-Store-Shopping

This program was an assignment I had to create for class.

In this program, the user will be prompted with a menu allowing them to choose between 5 diffrent items, Baseballs, Bats, Caps, Jerseys, and Gloves. The user will follow the directions on the menu to select what they would like to buy. If the user enters 6, the program will close. Each item has their own unique price as to be expected. Once the user has selected an item they would like to purchase, they will then enter a quantity of that item. The program then calculates to find and then display the Subtotal, Sales Tax, and the Total.
